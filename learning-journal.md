This time around through code 201 i feel mucg more confident in my abilities to create and understand code and do well in this class.  my understanding of topics such as object litterals, basic js functions and the html and css formatting are all becoming much clearer.  Im looking forward to the salmon cookies project being compleated and advancing into finals week.
